# FaceChat
FaceChat is an advanced AI-driven application that integrates chatbot functionality, text-to-speech (TTS), and real-time facial animation, leveraging NVIDIA's Audio2Face technology. This comprehensive pipeline allows users to interact with an AI chatbot through text or voice, with responses visualized via synchronized facial animation. Designed to enhance emotional support, FaceChat is particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing loneliness and for seniors who may find reading text or adapting to fast-changing technologies challenging. The application also has potential applications across diverse industries, including healthcare, customer service, and entertainment.

## Features
1. **Text Input**: Users can type messages directly into the chatbox and submit them by pressing Enter.

2. **Voice Input**: Allows voice interaction by clicking the microphone icon or holding the Space bar to start and stop recording


3. **Speech to Text**: Converts user voice input to text components using OpenAI Speech-To-Text functionality and insert them in the chat box.


4. **User Input Submission**: A Send button directs user inputs to the OpenAI Assistants API for processing.


5. **WebSockets Integration**: Utilizes WebSockets to transmit the AI-generated responses from script.js to generate_voice.py for further processing.

6. **Voice Synthesis**: Implements voice generation using a fine-tuned voice model via the ElevenLabs TTS API.

7. **Real-Time Facial Animation**: Sends voice chunks to NVIDIA Audio2Face, which produce natural and synchronized facial animations corresponding to the generated voice.

8. **WebRTC Streaming**: Streams the animated facial model to a locally hosted website using WebRTC, providing real-time visualization of the responses.

9. **Chat Log**: Displays the chat history in the top-left corner. Users can toggle it on or off using the visibility button.
