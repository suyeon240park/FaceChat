# FaceChat: Real-Time Emotion-Driven Text-to-Face Animation
FaceChat integrates emotion-driven text analysis with real-time facial animation. User input is processed using sentiment analysis model, and the output is converted into natural speech with OpenAI and ElevenLabs TTS APIs. The speech is then streamed to Audio2Face, which generates corresponding facial animations in real-time, displayed on a website via WebRTC.

While chatbots are widely used with the development of Artificial Intelligence, face-to-face interactions through AI are still emerging. FaceChat is developed to fill this gap. Originally designed to support seniors who find it challenging to read large amounts of text or adapt to fast-changing technologies, FaceChat also aims to provide emotional support to individuals facing loneliness in modern days. While still in its early stages, FaceChat explores the potential of a face-to-face conversational AI service in fields like healthcare, customer service, and entertainment.

## Features
FaceChat combines advanced emotion-driven text analysis with real-time facial animation for an immersive communication experience.

1. **Text Input**: Users can type messages directly into the chatbox.

2. **Voice Input**: Allows voice interaction by clicking the microphone icon or holding the Space bar to start and stop recording.

4. **Speech to Text**: Converts user voice input into text using OpenAI Speech-to-Text functionality and inserts it into the chatbox.

5. **User Input Submission**: A Send button or pressing Enter sends user inputs to the fine-tuned OpenAI Assistants API.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**: The response is analyzed using a sentiment analysis model developed from Googleâ€™s GoEmotions dataset, evaluating its emotional tone.

6. **Natural Speech**: The analyzed text is converted into natural-sounding speech using the ElevenLabs TTS (Text-to-Speech) API.

7. **Facial Animation**: The generated speech chunks are sent to the Audio2Face streaming player, which creates corresponding facial animations in real-time.

8. **WebRTC Streaming**: The animations are displayed on a website via WebRTC, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.
